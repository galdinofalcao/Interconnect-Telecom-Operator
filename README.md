# Interconnect Telecom Operator

## ***Machine Learning Project***

## **Description of the Problem:**
Interconnect Telecom Operator is developing a machine learning model to forecast customer churn. Customers identified as at risk of leaving will be offered promotional codes and tailored plan options.

## **Project Goal:**
The project's objective is to build a model that maximizes the AUC-ROC metric, with accuracy serving as a secondary performance measure.

In this project, the highest threshold for AUC-ROC is at least 0.88.

## **Tools and Libraries:**
- Python: Use Python programming language for data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis.
- Pandas: Manipulate and preprocess the data efficiently.
- Matplotlib, Seaborn: Create visualizations and charts for data exploration and presentation.
- Scikit-Learn (Sklearn): Model training, evaluation, and selection.
- Yandex (CatBoost): Model training, evaluation, and selection.

## **Data Documentation:**
The data consists of files obtained from different sources. In each file, the column customerID contains a unique code assigned to each client. The information given is as follows:

contract — contract information
personal — the client's personal data
internet — information about Internet services
phone — information about telephone services
